# vllm-radiance: vLLM/torch/triton/aiter stack for RDNA4 (gfx1201 / R9700), plus the radiance
# patches and kernels. Single multistage build on the official AMD ROCm image, in five stages:
#   1. builder    compile torch/triton/torchvision/aiter/vLLM from source into /wheels
#   2. rocmprune  cut the 19 GB ROCm tree down to this one GPU architecture
#   3. assemble   install the wheels, apply the patches, build the R4D kernel library
#   3b. venvsplit split the venv into a cold (stack) and a hot (radiance) layer
#   4. final      the release image: a clean Ubuntu with only the pruned ROCm and the venv
# No prebuilt component wheels and no checked-in binaries. The release image carries neither the
# build toolchain nor the wheels, which is most of the reason it is far smaller than the base.

# Component pins, in one place. Each is both the git tag that gets compiled and the version the
# resulting wheel reports, so `pip show`, `importlib.metadata`, and the startup banner all agree
# with what was actually built.
# torch/triton/torchvision are NOT free choices, and the number to read is not the one in
# pyproject.toml. At 0.27.1 upstream's own ROCm image (docker/Dockerfile.rocm_base) built
# PYTORCH_BRANCH=release/2.11 with torchvision v0.24.1 and triton 3.6.0 -- the sanctioned trio this
# fork used to build against, and requirements/rocm.txt itself pins no torch at all.
# RE-VERIFIED AT THIS BUMP (2026-09, fetched docker/Dockerfile.rocm_base from the v0.29.0 tag
# directly): upstream's OWN rocm_base Dockerfile has since moved to PYTORCH_BRANCH="6bbd260"
# (release/2.12 as of 08/02), TRITON_BRANCH="f0b55c0" (release/internal/3.7.x as of 08/18) and
# AITER_BRANCH="v0.1.19" -- none of which is torch 2.14.0 / triton 3.8.0 / aiter 0.1.21.post2.
# This bump is therefore, again, a combination upstream does not itself test on ROCm -- the exact
# risk category that made 0.5.0-0.5.4 hang the GPU under load (torch 2.13 / triton 3.7.1 /
# torchvision 0.28, reachable only because `use_existing_torch.py` strips the pin). Carried forward
# anyway because it is what this fork's target stack (vLLM 0.29.0 + newer aiter for gfx1201 MXFP4)
# needs; flagged here rather than silently assumed safe -- watch for the same symptom (fluent
# startup, hang under load) and be ready to fall back to upstream's own pinned trio if it appears.

# writing. patch_gdn_wmma covers the solve_tril triangular block-inverse only; the gated-delta-net
# gram cast is handled upstream since 0.26.0.
# patch_conv1d_blockn widens the gated-delta-net prefill conv1d channel block to a 16-byte-per-lane
# access; bit-identical, and it defuses a 2**14-byte row pitch the caller's split() view creates.
# patch_r4d is the whole libr4d integration in one patch, switchable at run time with
# RADIANCE_USE_R4D (see patch_r4d.py's own docstring for the three integration points).
# patch_dflash_fused_kv_fp8 lets that drafter be an fp8 checkpoint: the context-KV precompute
# fuses every layer's K/V projection by slicing the raw parameter, which is neither the right
# dtype nor the right row layout once the weights are quantized and preshuffled.
# patch_gdn_metadata cuts the per-step Python cost of building the gated-delta-net attention
# metadata: the per-request bookkeeping runs as one numpy pass over the same buffers, the arange
# and empty index become slices of cached buffers, and the block table is sliced rather than
# gathered when every sequence is a spec decode. Byte-identical output; RADIANCE_GDN_META=0 falls
# back to the stock path.
# patch_dflash_w4 marks the drafter's weight load so radiance_w4 can pack it to 4 bits -- the
# drafter's linears and the target's are indistinguishable inside a quant method's callback, and
# the drafter is loaded by exactly one call, so bracketing that call is the whole discriminator.
# Inert unless RADIANCE_FAST_DRAFT=1, the one switch over the whole tuned drafter stack: the draft
# pass falls 9.1% at a drafter batch of 64, and the acceptance question is settled -- acceptance on
# this stack is bimodal and the mode is drawn per compile, in the control arm too, so a single
# sample per arm reads a coin flip as a tax.
# RADIANCE_USE_R4D: the R4D attention backend enum, plus the gated-delta-net layer, where a whole
# step runs in five hand-written kernels (conv+prep+gating+cumsum, the K-gram with its triangular
# inverse, and the chunked scan on the prefill path; the conv update and the recurrent state
# update on the decode path), and the FLA chunk path still gets the fused scan for any step shape
# the layer hook declines. The two patches above tune that FLA path, which is what runs when
# RADIANCE_USE_R4D=0.
# DROPPED at the vLLM 0.29.0 bump, now native upstream (anchor-by-anchor verification in
# sly/README.md): patch_dflash2 (DFlash2 speculative decoding, vllm-project/vllm#52816, merged into
# vLLM itself ten days after 0.27.1 was tagged) and patch_dflash_base (the three DFlash correctness
# fixes DFlash2 depended on, including full cp_rank/cp_local_slot() context-parallelism support) --
# both now live in vllm/v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/dflash/speculator.py. patch_radiance_fusion is
# also dropped: AiterRMSNormQuantFusionPass.is_rdna_aiter_enabled() (vllm/compilation/passes/fusion/
# rocm_aiter_fusion.py, vllm/_aiter_ops.py) now reaches the same fusion automatically.
# sly/patch_quark_mxfp4.py puts the RadianceMxfp4W4A8LinearKernel plugin (sly/mxfp4/radiance_mxfp4.py
# + the radiance_mxfp4_fp8.hip kernel built below) at the head of ROCm's MXFP4 kernel list, and
# separately relaxes aiter's CDNA-only MXFP4 gates so its own Triton gemm_afp4wfp4 path is reachable
# on gfx1201 -- RADIANCE_MXFP4=1 for the aiter path, RADIANCE_MXFP4_W4A8=1 for the hand-written
# kernel layered on top; see sly/README.md for why both are needed rather than either alone.
# sly/patch_short_prefill.py fixes a gated-delta-net metadata-classification bug where a 1-token
# prefill (the common case for a cache-hit continuation) is misclassified as a decode step.
# sly/patch_dflash_w4_packed.py lets the DFlash drafter be a compressed-tensors W4A16 checkpoint
# (qkv_proj has weight_packed, no raw .weight -- deferred + dequantised like the fp8 case);
# sly/patch_gdn_nonspec_mask.py defines non_spec_sequence_masks_cpu on patch_gdn_metadata's numpy
# path (UnboundLocalError at engine init as soon as --speculative-config is set). Both are
# prerequisites for DFlash2 on the MXFP4 target (vllm7), verified 2026-09-15.
# sly/patch_lmhead_fp8.py hooks radiance_lmhead_fp8.py into QuarkConfig.get_quant_method: with
# RADIANCE_LMHEAD_FP8=1 the (Quark-excluded, otherwise bf16) lm_head is quantised to fp8 per
# output channel after loading and applied via row-wise torch._scaled_mm -- halves the 2.54 GB
# of weight traffic that the target verify and the DFlash draft each pull per step.
# sly/patch_w4a16_tiles.py adds a gfx1201 per-shape tile table to rdna_hybrid_w4a16.py for the
# DFlash2 W4A16 drafter (the stock gfx12x heuristic was tuned on Llama-3.1-8B shapes and picks
# 16x16 tiles at M<=32 -- 2176 workgroups for the 34816-wide gate_up); measured with
# sly/bench_w4a16_tiles.py, RADIANCE_W4A16_TILES=0 falls back to the heuristic.
# sly/patch_lmhead_int4.py hooks radiance_lmhead_int4.py in front of the fp8 block: with
# RADIANCE_LMHEAD_INT4=1 the lm_head is quantised to int4 (group-128 bf16 scales, MSE clip
# search) after loading and applied on the drafter's W4A16 kernel path (656 MB per call instead
# of fp8's 1.27 GB; the tile table above carries the lm_head entries). Must run after
# patch_lmhead_fp8 (it anchors on that block).
# sly/patch_lmhead_int4_ct.py puts the same hook into CompressedTensorsConfig.get_quant_method, for a
# compressed-tensors W4A16 target (RedHatAI/Qwen3.8-27B-INT4, lm_head in `ignore` = bf16); the DFlash
# drafter's head has no quant_config and is shared, so only the target head changes.
# sly/patch_fused_norm_quant.py hooks radiance_fused_norm.py (0.1.6, RADIANCE_FUSED_NORM_QUANT=1,
# default off) into Qwen3.5/Qwen3-Next: the decoder add+rms_norm, the MLP silu*up and the GDN
# gated norm each end in the per-token fp8 quant (radiance_add_rms_quant / _silu_mul_quant /
# _gdn_norm_quant in the .hip below) and hand (q, scale) straight to the W4A8 GEMM's pq entry,
# plus the knob in vLLM's compile cache key. Anchors are the already-patched files, so it runs last.
# sly/patch_mamba_align_retire.py backports vllm#55450 (0.2.3): align-mode Mamba state retirement
# skips null gaps instead of stopping at them -- with async scheduling the stock code pinned one
# gated-delta-net block per group per prefill chunk until the request finished (258k prompt: KV
# pool exhausted, two self-preemptions).
# sly/patch_rocm_load_max_split.py lets Worker.load_model's max_split_size_mb:20 allocator scope run
# on ROCm (stock gates it on is_cuda()): without it, packed W4A16 weights were carved out of the
# freed 2.37 GiB bf16 embed/lm_head segments and pinned them (INT4 target k=7: 2.9 GiB stranded,
# 313k -> 386k KV tokens; MXFP4 prod: 376k -> 386k).
# patch_tp3_pad (ggz14) installs the three radiance_tp3pad.py hooks for TP=3 via zero-weight dummy
# heads; every hook returns immediately unless RADIANCE_TP_PAD=3, so TP 1/2 serves are unchanged.
# sly/patch_ar_knobs.py makes the TP=2 all-reduce size gate (RADIANCE_AR_MAX_KB) and the 6-bit
# wire geometry env-tunable; defaults are the shipped values.
# patch_nvfp4_mxfp4.py (ggz14, 2026-09-15) serves compressed-tensors NVFP4 checkpoints
# (unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4) by requantizing every linear to MXFP4 at load (radiance_nvfp4.py) and
# handing it to the same W4A8 kernel plugin the Quark checkpoint runs on. Inert unless
# RADIANCE_NVFP4_MXFP4=1; it only touches compressed-tensors scheme selection, never QuarkConfig.

# --- R4D: the gfx1201 kernel library, cloned and compiled from source ---
# sly/r4d/r4d_extras_rx10.patch is ggz14's r4d_radiance_extras_rx10.patch (written against libr4d
# b9e42ab) rebased onto this pin: the kernel sources applied as-is, the four registry files
# (build.sh, r4d.h, r4d_module.hip, r4d_registry.hip) were merged by hand -- every conflict was
# additive, the pin's N-rank all-reduce family next to the extras. It adds the narrow-state (bf16 /
# fp16 SSM cache) gated-delta-net decode kernels that radiance_gdn.py binds when
# --mamba-ssm-cache-dtype is 16-bit, the lazy-snapshot GDN kernels (RADIANCE_GDN_LAZY), the fused
# GDN decode step (RADIANCE_GDN_FUSED_UPDATE), the 8-bit legs of the R4D prefill attention
# (R4D_ATTN_FP8, R4D backend only) and the TP=2 all-reduce with a fused decoder epilogue. ggz14's
# three-rank all-reduce is left out: it was written for the older two-rank radiance_allreduce.py,
# and this image ships StillDeadcode's N-rank module, which has no binding for it -- TP=3 all-reduces
# ride RCCL.
# One shared object holding every hand-written kernel this image runs: paged attention (prefill and
# decode, fp8 or bf16 KV), the fused gated-delta-net prefill scan, the TP=2 P2P all-reduce in both
# its exact and its 6-bit-packed form, the skinny bf16 GEMM, and (since this pin) the OCP-MXFP4 x
# fp8 skinny GEMM gemm_mxfp4a8_nt_m64 that sly/mxfp4/radiance_mxfp4.py's RADIANCE_MXFP4_R4D_DECODE_MAX_M
# path reads via `r4d.select("gemm_nt", ..., dtype="mxfp4a8")`. Built here rather than in the
# builder stage because it has to be compiled by the same hipcc the venv loads it against.
# ARGs are declared at the point of use: they are cache-key instructions, so putting them at the top
# of the stage would invalidate the wheel install above on every kernel bump.

# SHAs. `git fetch <sha>` instead, confirmed against Codeberg's Gitea directly (a live
# `git fetch --depth 1 origin <sha>` against this exact repo returned the object, i.e.
# uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant is on) -- so this stays a shallow single-object fetch, not a full
# clone. This ALSO changes the shape of the correctness check below: the previous version compared
# `r4d.__version__` (from `#define R4D_VERSION "..."` in r4d.h) against the pinned tag, but that
# macro was NOT bumped by either of the two PRs merged into main after v0.5.0 -- confirmed via
# `git log -p -- r4d.h` against the live repo, it still reads "0.5.0" at this exact commit. Asserting
# a stale clone therefore now means asserting the CHECKED-OUT COMMIT equals the pin (what the

# --- RADIANCE MXFP4 W4A8: the hand-written fp8-WMMA GEMM kernel for gfx1201, compiled here for the

#     loads it against, and this is the only stage that has the full (unpruned) ROCm dev tree. ---
# sly/mxfp4/radiance_mxfp4_fp8.hip is a SINGLE-FILE pybind11 extension (no torch/ATen headers --
# every exported fn takes raw `uintptr_t` addresses, see its own PYBIND11_MODULE block), unlike
# R4D's multi-translation-unit build.sh, so it compiles with one hipcc invocation rather than a
# library build script. It has to be importable as the bare module name `radiance_mxfp4_fp8`
# (`import radiance_mxfp4_fp8 as _ext` in sly/mxfp4/radiance_mxfp4.py, copied to ${SP}/ above) --
# same trick as r4d.so above: CPython's default EXTENSION_SUFFIXES includes plain ".so", so an
# unadorned `<modname>.so` dropped straight into site-packages is importable with no build-tag
# renaming needed. Placed in ${SP} rather than /opt/patches so a stale copy in the patch tree can
# never shadow it (see radiance_mxfp4.py's own comment on the exact same risk for this file).
# torch is imported before the extension for the same reason as R4D's check above and the
# release-stage JIT probe below: a bare HIP extension has no ROCm entry in ld.so.conf and cannot
# resolve libamdhip64 on its own, so `import radiance_mxfp4_fp8` alone fails with
# "ImportError: libamdhip64.so.7: cannot open shared object file" even though the .so just linked
# fine -- torch's import is what actually pulls the runtime into the process.

# Qwen-Fixed-Chat-Templates, Apache-2.0, repo revision 855bffc). It fixes the official 3.8 template's
# xhigh-by-default reasoning, the blank <think></think> blocks it injects into chat history (a
# prefix-cache miss on every turn), crashes on JSON-string tool arguments and enable_thinking=false,
# and maps client effort aliases (high/max -> xhigh, none/off -> thinking off). Serve with
# `--chat-template /opt/qwen-fixed.jinja`; the path stays the same across template versions, the
# version is in the label io.slybase.radiance.chat-template and in the file's first line.

# description and source on the registry manifest too, where ghcr.io reads them. Kept last:
# VCS_REF and BUILD_DATE change with every build, and a changed ARG invalidates every RUN below it.
# build.yml passes RADIANCE_VERSION (= VERSION), VCS_REF and BUILD_DATE; a local build says dev/unknown.
# ref.name only overrides the base image's own value ("ubuntu"), which would otherwise show through.
